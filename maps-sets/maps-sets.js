// Maps and Sets

// Data structures in JavaScript
// * Data structures are formats for efficiently collecting or storing data
// * So far we’ve seen Arrays and Objects
// * ES2015 introduces two new ones, Maps and Sets

// Maps
// * Also called “hash maps” in other languages
// * Until ES2015 - objects were replacements for maps
// * Similar to objects, except the keys can be ANY data type!
// * Created using the new keyword
